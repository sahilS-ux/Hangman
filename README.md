Hangman Game 
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that combines elements of strategy, vocabulary, and fun. The game is typically played by two or more players, where one player thinks of a word or phrase, and the other player attempts to guess it by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.
How to Play

    Choosing a Word: One player (the "host") selects a secret word or phrase and represents it with a series of blank spaces, each corresponding to a letter in the word.

    Guessing Letters: The other player (the "guesser") attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, the host fills in the corresponding blank spaces with that letter.

    Incorrect Guesses: If the guessed letter is not in the word, the host marks an incorrect guess, often drawing a part of a hangman figure (traditionally, a gallows and a stick figure). The game continues until the guesser either successfully identifies the word or exhausts the allowed number of incorrect guesses.

    Winning the Game: The guesser wins by correctly identifying the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn. Conversely, the host wins if the guesser fails to guess the word within the allowed attempts.
